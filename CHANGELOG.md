## What I Built

An interactive Learning Progress Dashboard that visualizes David's ongoing education journey through:
- **Python CS50P** (Week 5 - File I/O)
- **Math for AI/ML** (Probability & Statistics - Bayes' Theorem)

### Features
- Animated progress bars for both learning tracks
- Visual streak calendar (13-day streak!)
- Today's focus with code examples for each track
- Expandable lesson timeline showing all completed lessons
- Practice exercises for daily learning
- Overall statistics sidebar

---

## Why It Helps

Instead of checking a JSON file manually, this dashboard gives David an at-a-glance view of:
- Current progress in both learning tracks
- What to focus on today
- How far he's come (24 lessons completed!)
- Maintaining his learning streak motivation

## How to Test

1. Open the live URL above
2. **NEW:** Check Python track - Day 14 shows OOP Inheritance with `super()` and `__str__` examples
3. **NEW:** Check Math track - Day 14 shows Covariance/Correlation with NumPy code
4. Click "Show All Lessons" to see all 14 completed lessons in each track
5. Verify sidebar shows "28 lessons completed" and "15-day streak"

## Next Optimization

1. **Module 4 - Optimization:** Add content for the final Math for AI module (Gradient Descent variants, Learning Rates, Regularization)
2. **CS50P Week 8:** Add final Python topics (Et Cetera - Decorators, Generators, Comprehensions)
3. **Quiz Integration:** Add interactive quizzes after each lesson to test retention
4. **Progress Persistence:** Store progress in localStorage or Notion so streak isn't reset on refresh
