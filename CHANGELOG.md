**Build Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Status:** ✅ LIVE

## What I Built

An interactive Learning Progress Dashboard that visualizes David's ongoing education journey through:
- **Python CS50P** (Week 5 - File I/O)
- **Math for AI/ML** (Probability & Statistics - Bayes' Theorem)

### Features
- Animated progress bars for both learning tracks
- Visual streak calendar (13-day streak!)
- Today's focus with code examples for each track
- Expandable lesson timeline showing all completed lessons
- Practice exercises for daily learning
- Overall statistics sidebar

---

## Why It Helps

Instead of checking a JSON file manually, this dashboard gives David an at-a-glance view of:
- Current progress in both learning tracks
- What to focus on today
- How far he's come (24 lessons completed!)
- Maintaining his learning streak motivation

## Next Optimization

1. **Live Data Integration:** Connect to Notion or a JSON API so progress updates automatically when `learning-progress.json` changes
2. **Interactive Code Runner:** Add a code execution environment to test the Python examples directly in the browser
3. **Mobile Responsive:** Improve the layout for mobile viewing during commute/idle time
4. **Add Ark Academy Track:** Create a third track for Ark Academy curriculum progress
